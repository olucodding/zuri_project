1. Add Products to Cart
•	User Action: The user browses the product listings and clicks the "Add to Cart" button for the desired product(s).
•	Backend Process:
o	The add_to_cart.php script receives the product ID, user ID (if logged in), and the quantity.
o	The script checks if the product is already in the user's cart.
	If yes, it updates the quantity.
	If no, it inserts a new record into the cart table with the product details, user ID, and quantity.
o	The user is redirected to the cart.php page to view the cart.
2. View and Manage Cart
•	User Action: The user navigates to the cart.php page to view the items in their cart.
•	Backend Process:
o	The cart.php page queries the cart table for the current user's cart items.
o	It calculates the subtotal (sum of the product prices times their quantities).
o	A shipping fee (e.g., 7.5%) is added to the subtotal.
o	The user can update quantities or remove items from the cart.
o	If changes are made, the cart is updated in the database.

3. Proceed to Checkout
•	User Action: The user clicks the "Proceed to Checkout" button on the cart.php page.
•	Backend Process:
o	The user is redirected to the checkout.php page.
o	The checkout.php page retrieves the cart items and calculates the total order amount (subtotal + shipping).
o	The user is prompted to select a payment method (e.g., bank transfer, cash on delivery).
o	If the user selects bank transfer, they must attach proof of payment.
4. Submit Order
•	User Action: The user reviews the order details and submits the order.
•	Backend Process:
o	The order details are inserted into the orders table, including the user ID, order date, total amount, and payment method.
o	Each cart item is inserted into the order_items table linked to the order ID.
o	The cart table is cleared for the user.
o	If the payment method is bank transfer, the proof of payment is stored and associated with the order.
5. Confirm Payment
•	User Action: If the user selected bank transfer, they wait for payment confirmation.
•	Backend Process:
o	The system (or admin) verifies the bank transfer proof.
o	Upon successful verification, the order status is updated to "Payment Confirmed".
o	An email confirmation or order receipt is sent to the user.



6. Order Processing and Fulfillment
•	Backend Process:
o	The order is processed, and the products are prepared for shipping.
o	The inventory is updated by reducing the quantity of the ordered products.
o	The order status is updated to "Shipped" once dispatched.
7. Delivery and Order Completion
•	User Action: The user receives the product(s).
•	Backend Process:
o	The order status is updated to "Delivered" upon successful delivery.
o	The user is notified of the delivery, and the order is marked as complete.
8. Post-Order Actions
•	User Action: The user can leave feedback or request support.
•	Backend Process:
o	The system may prompt the user for reviews or ratings of the purchased products.
o	The system archives the order for future reference.
Each of these steps involves interactions between the front-end (user actions) and back-end (PHP scripts, database interactions) to ensure a seamless order processing workflow.
